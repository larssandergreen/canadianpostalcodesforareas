# canadianpostalcodesforareas

Adds options for first 3 and first 5 characters of postal codes without country to the Areas extension, plus the full postal code without country and city without country or with country equal or empty. In Canadian Postal Codes, the first 3 characters define a Forward Sort Area (smaller city or part of larger city) and smaller towns often use the same first 5 characters.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).
